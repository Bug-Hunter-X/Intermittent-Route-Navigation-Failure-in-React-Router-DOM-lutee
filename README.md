# Intermittent Route Navigation Failure in React Router DOM

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered in React Router DOM v6 where route navigation fails intermittently. The issue is difficult to reliably reproduce, making debugging challenging.

## Description

The application uses basic routes: Home, About, and a 404 Not Found page.  Navigation between these routes usually works as expected, however, under certain (currently unknown) conditions, navigation fails silently; the URL changes in the browser, but the UI does not reflect the new route. The previous route remains displayed.

## Steps to Reproduce (Inconsistent)

While the bug is not consistently reproducible, attempts to trigger the error may involve:

* Rapid route changes
* Certain browser actions (e.g., browser resizing, tab switching)
* Network latency

## Potential Causes (Speculative)

Possible underlying issues might include:

* Asynchronous operations interfering with routing updates.
* State management conflicts.
* Browser-specific rendering quirks.

## Solution (Workaround)

The provided solution utilizes `useLocation` and a state variable to force a re-render when the location changes, effectively addressing the intermittent rendering problem.  This is a workaround, not a solution to the underlying cause.  Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root of the issue.
